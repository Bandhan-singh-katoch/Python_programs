# ------------Operator ------------
# i will write only that part which i don't know

# ------Arithmetic operators------
x = 5; y = 2
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)    # Divides completely with fraction
print(x//y)   # Quotient
print(x%y)    # Remainder
print(x**y)   # power operator

# Comparison operators : > , < , >= , <= , != , == are the comparison operators and they return true or false

# Logical operators: and , or , not are the logical operators in python.
a = 1; b = False
print("a and b = ",a and b)
print("a or b = ",a or b)
print("not a =", not a)

# Bitwise operator : Bitwise operators acts on operands as if they were strings of binary digits.
m = 10       # 1010
n = 4        # 0100
print(m&n)   # 0  Bitwise and
print(m|n)   # 14 Bitwise or
print(~m)    # -(1010+1) Bitwise not operator: returns one's compliment of the number
print(m^n)   # XOR operator
